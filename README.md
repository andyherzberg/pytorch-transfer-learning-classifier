# Pytorch Transfer Learning Classifier: To Bee or not to bee?

This Jupyter notebook is a Deep Learning transfer learning project that can be run on Google colab. The resulting model can differentiate between bees, wasps and humble bees. It was trained with about 60 images per class. See some random samples below.

The notebook can be run on Google where all models, optimizer params and a log is stored. After training the classifier has an accuracy of 95+% on the unseen validation set.
